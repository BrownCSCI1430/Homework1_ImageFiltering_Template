Ever since its invention a shade more than 150 years ago, photography has been seen as a medium of truth and unassailable accuracy. Photographs have been used by scientists to map the planets and identify subatomic particles, by police and prosecutors to solve crimes and convince juries, by newspaper and magazine editors to document events around the world - and few think twice about it. Even everyday snapshots serve as litmus tests of social reality to millions of eyes. In the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes, a photograph serves as a "mirror with a memory."

Today, however, the veracity of photographic reality is being radically challenged. The immediate menace - although by no means the only one - is known as computer imaging, an outgrowth of electronic technology that allows anyone to alter a photographic image at will. This much-touted technology makes it easy to recompose and combine photographic images, and to do so in a way that is virtually undetectable.

In the future, it seems almost certain, photographs will appear less like facts and more like factoids - as a kind of unsettled and unsettling hybrid imagery based not so much on observable reality and actual events as on the imagination. This shift, which to a large extent has already occurred within the rarefied precincts of the art world, will fundamentally alter not only conventional ideas about the nature of photography but also many cherished conceptions about reality itself.

As electronic images enhanced by computers replace the light-sensitive film photographs to which we are now accustomed, they will inevitably have an impact on fields ranging from art to the law, as well as creating new ones as yet unimagined. Those disciplines based on the veracity of photographic appearances, including photojournalism, will either change radically in appearance or wither.

In the future, readers of newspapers and magazines will probably view news pictures more as illustrations than as reportage, since they will be well aware that they can no longer distinguish between a genuine image and one that has been manipulated. Even if news photographers and editors resist the temptations of electronic manipulation, as they are likely to do, the credibility of all reproduced images will be diminished by a climate of reduced expectations. In short, photographs will not seem as real as they once did.

The decline in the status of photographs as mirrors of reality is not due solely to the arrival of computerized means for altering them, however. The social perception of the medium, which in the final analysis is what determines its persuasive powers, has changed gradually over the course of its history. In the 19th century, photography's hold on the public imagination was so great that even blatantly faked "spirit" photographs, in which ghosts seemed to hover over the living, thanks to the now commonplace technique of double exposure, were taken at face value. As William M. Ivins Jr. put it in his classic 1953 book, "Prints and Visual Communications": "The 19th century began by believing that what was reasonable was true, and it would end up by believing that what it was a photograph of was true."

The inherent believability of photographs is a result of their scientific origins in optics and chemistry, as well as of their reliance on Renaissance perspective, which to Western eyes seems perfectly natural. When Americans landed on the Moon in 1969, for example, it was neither the crackling radio transmission nor blurry television images that convinced most of the world of the feat. What served as incontrovertible evidence was Neil Armstrong's eerily sharp color photograph of Buzz Aldrin standing on the pockmarked lunar surface, a reflection of the photographer on his helmet.

Yet when Walker Evans was asked if the camera could lie, the great American photographer is reported to have said, "Always." To Evans, a sophisticated Modernist, the camera was "the instrument of symbolic actuality," not of actuality itself. Evans also believed that photography was the most literary of the graphic arts. Like literature, it seems always to be telling us something, about ourselves and about the world. It is this literary quality that has made the medium so fascinating to 20th-century thinkers on the order of Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes and Susan Sontag.

Before the announcement of photography in 1839, painting bore the weight of narrating history. Painting was, in the critic Robert Hughes's words, "our index of the real." Its capabilities for description were used to record everything from the success of cave dwellers' hunting parties to the conquests of Napoleon. But photographs usurped that social and cultural function, freeing painters to concentrate on their impressions of the visible world and, eventually, abstraction.

Now, it could be argued, photography stands in much the same place as painting did 150 years ago. Its method of recording reality is no longer as rapid, versatile or cost efficient as electronically based video systems, including television. In a technological sense, it is a dinosaur. Consequently, its conversion into something that approaches fiction is a reflection of the end of an era. Like painting, photographs no longer need to hold a mirror up to life.

## Remaking Reality By Computer

Whether this state of affairs ultimately is for better or worse remains to be seen, since one can find in it both the promise of new possibilities and grounds for regret. It is already calling into question the essential assumptions of those fields, like photojournalism, that depend on the widespread acceptance of photographs as truth. Advertising photography, on the other hand, which has a long tradition of manipulation and fabrication as a means of achieving marketable perfection, may provide a model for how all photographs will look in the future.

Another potential model for factoid photographs is commercial film. Hollywood movies, which are increasingly in thrall to special effects generated by computer-imaging systems, are accountable only to the demands of entertainment, not to those of truth. Films can indulge in hyperbolic fantasies, in which jumbo jets are blown to bits and the Holy Grail is finally discovered, without losing their mass appeal; why not photographs?

Within the last few years the manipulation of photographs by computer has become a fairly simple operation. A special machine "scans" the photographic image (in either negative or print form), creating a computer code of its shapes, tones and colors. Once this code is entered into the computer's memory, the image can be reconstructed, dot by dot, using a conventional keyboard or "mouse" and software designed for the purpose. Even historically important photographs can be refashioned to provide a new version of the past; in the altered photograph of the Yalta Conference reproduced on page one, Groucho Marx replaces Joseph Stalin, while Sylvester Stallone adds Rambo's presence. Colors can be brightened, backgrounds extended, unsightly elements erased. If desired, elements from other photographs can be added to the image, with shadows drawn in to blend them into the scene. The result, while not yet as seamless as a conventional photograph because of its visible dot structure, can be printed out on paper or transformed directly into printing plates. When printed, the revamped image's telltale computer dots are masked by those of the printing plates.

At the high end of image manipulation are machines like those made by Scitex America Corporation, a Medford, Mass., company that could be called the Bell Telephone of computer imaging. Scitex machines are now installed at large advertising agencies, where they are used regularly to "improve" photographs on orders from art directors. The machines can also be found at many magazines and newspapers, where they have a role in the preparation of color photographs for printing. But black-and-white photographs can also be changed using basic Apple Macintosh computers and inexpensive, readily available software. (A Scitex machine already installed at The New York Times will be used for preparing and producing news and advertising materials once the newspaper begins printing some sections in color. The Times now uses Macintosh computers in its art and photography departments to crop, scale and lay out black and white pictures; the newspaper's policy prohibits any content alteration of the image.) In the field of art, the ability to alter photographs is seen as an opportunity. Graduate students in photography at the School of Visual Arts in New York City are being taught to manipulate photographic images by computer as part of their required curriculum. The school also offers a master's degree program in "Computer Art," in which students study the brief history of computer graphics, learn programming and use "paint systems" - programs used to create and manipulate images by computer.

A few artists have begun to investigate the possibilities of computer-aided imagery. Nancy Burson, for example, works with David Kramlich, a programmer, to produce computer-generated portraits. She combines several photographs of movie stars to make an "ideal" star, produces such bizarre composites as a portrait of herself as a cat and takes a single portrait image and makes its subject years younger or older. (Using the latter technique, she has done "updates" of missing children, including Etan Patz, who disappeared from a SoHo street in 1979 at the age of 6 and remains missing.) Other artists, like David Em, use computers to create entirely imaginary scenes that bear an uncanny resemblance to photographic reality.

## The Perils For Photojournalism

But the same technology that opens new horizons for artists poses a conundrum for photojournalists and their editors. Fred Ritchin, the author of a recent cautionary book about the implications of manipulating photographs by computer ("In Our Own Image: The Coming Revolution in Photography," Aperture), warns that because the magnetic storage disks used by still video cameras are "made to be used again, and each image can be individually erased and recorded over, there is no equivalent to an original, archivally permanent negative."

It is impossible to tell whether an electronic image comes directly from a camera or is enhanced by a computer. As Mr. Ritchin puts it, "If an editor or production person alters the image en route to the printer, and the photographer records over the original image, then it is virtually impossible to prove how the image was changed, or even the fact that it was retouched." Relatively innocuous but routine examples of such electronic retouching include eliminating dust spots and scratches from prints, making montages and silhouettes, and extending backgrounds to fit a predetermined format. Such practices are not new, but computer technology makes them less labor intensive and less obvious.

Mr. Ritchin fears that computer manipulation of photojournalistic images will prove too tempting for news editors to resist, and he cites several examples that suggest that some editors have already succumbed. In 1982 National Geographic magazine moved two pyramids closer together to improve the composition of its cover. In 1985 Rolling Stone erased a pistol and shoulder holster from under the arm of Don Johnson, the star of "Miami Vice." For the cover of the best-selling "Day in the Life of America," a computer was used to bring a cowboy and his mount closer to a nearby tree.

Eventually, the author concludes, "not only journalism, but snapshots and documentary photography of every sort will be affected. Cultural history, political events, personal memories - all will be newly suspect while the photograph's long reign as society's high-tech but humble scribe becomes increasingly vulnerable."

## Updating The Airbrush

Photography has never been an entirely impartial observer, of course, any more than photojournalism can claim to be wholly objective or dispassionate. This is because the meaning of photographs is determined not so much by the camera as by the human being behind the machine and by the contexts in which the resulting images are seen. In addition, the manipulation of photographs - often in a way that alters their meaning - has a history of its own.

Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and China have long been known for removing the visages of "nonpersons" from official pictures. Entertainment tabloids like The National Enquirer regularly enhance their checkout-counter appeal by combining faces from two photographs. (Recently Newsweek joined this tacky coterie, putting the stars of the movie "Rain Man" together in a single image.) Using an airbrush to eliminate distracting backgrounds from news pictures was once a regular step in the production of daily newspapers, and at some it still is.

The virus of manipulation infects even some of the classic images of photojournalism. Take W. Eugene Smith's well-known image of Dr. Albert Schweitzer, for example. According to the photographer's biographer, Jim Hughes, Smith was faced with a technically inferior negative with a fogged lower right-hand corner. To solve the problem, and to add a layer of symbolism to the image, Smith added elements of a second negative in the printing process. The result, which in truth is a photomontage, was published by Life as if it were a single image.

Even when images are not overtly manipulated, the purported facts in a photograph are subject to interpretation. Robert Capa's famous 1936 image from the Spanish civil war, showing a soldier falling backward, appeared in Life above a caption stating that the photograph shows the man "the instant he is dropped by a bullet through the head." But critics have contended that the falling soldier reappears in a later frame on the same roll of film, and that the supposed "moment of death" scene could merely be a training exercise.

Ultimately, the picture's meaning, and the meaning of all photographs, depends on what viewers choose to believe about it. It is the belief that photographs are neutral records of reality that computer imaging calls into question.

## The Believable Image

Artists, who often serve as messengers of cultural change, have anticipated and largely accepted the obsolescence of photographic fact. Beginning in the 1970's, Conceptual and "story" artists like Bill Beckley, Robert Cumming, Jean le Gac, Ger Van Elk and William Wegman staged photographs that disputed the medium's claims to documentary objectivity.

The 1980's saw the rampant exploitation of photography's fictional qualities. Sandy Skoglund's tableau "Revenge of the Goldfish" and Cindy Sherman's series of "Untitled Film Stills" have all the hallmarks of the new attitude toward photographs: they embrace blatant artificiality; they allude to and draw from an "image world" of endless pre-existing photographs, and they reduce the world to the status of a film set.

Much post-modernist art of recent vintage can be at least partly understood in terms of photography's loss of documentary authority, and the resulting sense that reality is not a fixed subject but a constantly evolving construction of culture. According to this interpretation, advanced most persuasively by the French social critic Jean Baudrillard, photography is not a mirror of reality but merely a hall of mirrors. Along with film, television and the graphic arts, it serves as an agent of cultural representation, providing images that create an acceptable simulacrum of the real.

One could even argue that photography's loss of its documentary authority has less to do with the arrival of video and computer images than it does with its own superabundance and stereotypicality. The sense of the artificiality of photographic images, which is so thoroughly inscribed in the art of the 80's, has its origins not in any abstruse foreign theory but in everyday American existence. Camera pictures can no longer be taken at face value, and most of us know it.

## Can Video Supply the Facts?

If photographs can no longer be perceived as unalloyed facts peeled from the surface of the real world, what will replace them? The temptation is to say video images, since electronic image making increasingly bears the primary responsibility for supplying society with pictures. But the prospect that video will inherit photography's former truth-bearing function is limited by its even greater susceptibility to computer manipulation.

Some have speculated that an enterprising computer wizard could, for instance, create a visual data bank of all of former President Ronald Reagan's speeches and then, using a montage of the recorded images and sounds at his disposal, make the President's video image speak entirely new sentences - literally put words in his mouth. At a time when governments can deny the reality of unmanipulated television pictures, as China has done in the case of last year's Tiananmen Square uprising, the notion of a fabricated video reality seems especially frightening.

Not everyone agrees that a brave new world of computer-manufactured imagery, whether photographic or electronic, is inevitable. Peter Campus, an artist who made interactive video installations 20 years ago and whose recent work consists of drawings made with the aid of a computer, contends that "just because the technology exists doesn't mean it is going to be used." Mr. Campus cites the example of holography, which was ballyhooed in the 1970's as a revolutionary form of image making. Today holograms are found by the millions on credit cards, but they have yet to change our picture of reality.

Even Mr. Ritchin, in "In Our Own Image," acknowledges that traditional photography may yet have some life in it: "The photograph that discovers and uncovers the world is harder to simulate than an image that simply illustrates one's ideas about it."
